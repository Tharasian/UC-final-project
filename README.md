### Mushroom Forest and the Darkness beneath

# Idea
2D Platformer inspired by megaman X(MMX), Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest. 
The game had a few issues with cooldown management and inconsistencies. Using fixedDeltaTime for managing the cooldown helped a lot. There are a few issues still where the boss might teleport behind the platform and become inaccessible. Game difficulty will vary based on how the player is familiar with the game. Fireballs proved to be strong but a must for melee attacks can be weak due to colliding with enemies which will make u lose health
The project is by no means done, as the game still required some tweaks and more levels. Adding sound effects and particle effects to certain animations and actions as well.


# Future Work 
I am hoping to advance on this work and create a 2D platformer similar to the MMX series
